Day 1: Spent most of the day wandering the back alleys, canals, and old streets admiring the immense beauty of this amazing city.
![Love finding stuff like this.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0e00551de5df9c3665647a32f776f6c57fb6a79d.jpg)

Love all of the random street art you come across.  A very cool contrast against the old Architecture.
